Sure, here's a schema for a car ticket booking system:

Users Table

id (int, primary key)
name (varchar)
email (varchar)
password (varchar)
Cars Table

id (int, primary key)
model (varchar)
brand (varchar)
capacity (int)
price_per_km (float)
available (boolean)
Bookings Table

id (int, primary key)
user_id (int, foreign key references users.id)
car_id (int, foreign key references cars.id)
pickup_location (varchar)
destination (varchar)
pickup_date (datetime)
return_date (datetime)
total_price (float)
This schema includes three tables: Users, Cars, and Bookings. The Users table stores information about users, including their name, email, and password. The Cars table stores information about available cars, including their model, brand, capacity, price per kilometer, and availability status. Finally, the Bookings table stores information about bookings made by users, including the user's ID, the car's ID, the pickup and destination locations, pickup and return dates, and the total price.

This schema can be further extended with additional tables to include information about car rental locations, payment methods, and so on, depending on the needs of the system.
