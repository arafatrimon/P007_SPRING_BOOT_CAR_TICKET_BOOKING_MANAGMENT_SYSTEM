This updated schema includes additional tables and fields to provide more information about users, cars, bookings, and payments. The Users table has been updated to include fields for date of birth and driving license number, which can be used to verify that the user is eligible to rent a car. The Cars table has been updated to include fields for color and body type, which can be used to provide more detailed information about the car.

The Bookings table has been updated to include fields for insurance information and notes, which can be used to record additional information about the booking. The Payments table has been updated to include fields for the user who made the payment, the booking for which the payment was made, and the payment method used.

Again, depending on the specific requirements of the car ticket booking system, additional tables or fields may be needed to store other relevant information.
